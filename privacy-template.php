                 Weuses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. 
                 (“Google”). Google Analytics uses “cookies”, which are text files placed on 
                 your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site. The 
                 information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your 
                 IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United 
                 States.
                 <br>
                 In case of activation of the IP anonymization, Google will truncate/anonymize 
                 the last octet of the IP address for Member States of the European Union as well 
                 as for other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in 
                 exceptional cases, the full IP address is sent to and shortened by Google servers 
                 in the USA.
                 <br>
                 On behalf of the website provider Google will use this information for the 
                 purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website 
                 activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website 
                 activity and internet usage to the website provider. Google will not associate 
                 your IP address with any other data held by Google.

                 You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your

                 By default, the browsing experience of website visitors is tracked by 
                 Google Analytics in order to produce anonymised statistics.
                 <br>
                 Furthermore you can prevent Google’s collection and use of data (cookies and 
                 IP address) by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under 
                 https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en. Please note that on this website, 
                 Google Analytics code is supplemented by “gat._anonymizeIp();” to ensure an 
                 anonymized collection of IP addresses (so called IP-masking).
